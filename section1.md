# SECTION: The DOM and Declarative Programming

- ## DOM
  - A collection of objects in the computer memory that represent HTML elements 
  - It generates document that is being changed and analyze to users. 
  - HTML(TEXT file) -> Browser converts as DOM -> Browser render/paint based on DOM
    * Render can be different based on whether from React or DOM

    - ex) step by step by step... 
    - <pre></pre>
  - Declarative Programming : what a program should accomplish W/O "how"
    - ex) tell step on what to do.
